## 0.2.0

### Features

Modified `getNormalIntervalProbabilities` so that, if given a standard deviation of 0, it returns uniform probabilities.

## 0.1.0

### Features

Added functions:

- `computeCdf`: Computes the cumulative distribution function of a given distribution.
- `getNormalIntervalProbabilities`: Computes probabilities across intervals of a normal distribution.
- `toAddendsFromCumulativeSums`: Converts a list of cumulative sums to a list of addends.
- `toCumulativeSumsFromAddends`: Converts a list of addends to a list of cumulative sums.

### Tooling

Added the scaffolding for the library.
